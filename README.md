# Random Spanning Trees 
My masters thesis at CMI on Random Spanning Trees. The following this the approximate content of the thesis. A much more updated version is [here](https://github.com/bhi5hmaraj/masters-thesis/blob/master/thesis/main.pdf) . The template used is available [here](https://www.sunilpatel.co.uk/thesis-template/).
