abstract = {Abstract A simplified model of a communications network is a probabilistic graph in which each edge operates with the same probability. The all-terminal reliability, or probability that all nodes are connected, can be expressed as a polynomial in the edge operation probability. The coefficients of this polynomial are obtained from an interval partitioning of the cographic matroid, and only the first few coefficients can be computed efficiently. One of the best sets of efficiently computable reliability bounds is the Ball-Provan bounds. These bounds are obtained using the efficiently computable coefficients and can be improved substantially if additional coefficients are known. In this paper, we develop a Monte Carlo method for estimating additional coefficients by randomly sampling over spanning trees of the network. Confidence intervals for all-terminal reliability are obtained by using these estimates as additional constraints in the Ball-Provan bounds. This approach has some advantages over conventional Monte Carlo point estimate methods. In particular, the computational complexity does not depend on the reliability of the network.},

The unranking function maps any interval [1, s] to the corresponding tree, while the ranking function maps a spanning tree to the appropriate index in the interval.

In this paper we develop an algorithm to generate a random subset U ∈ B such that the P(U = B) is proportioned to w(B). If the complexity of computing sums of the weights of B contained in set-intervals in B is O(f(∥E∥)), then the algorithm developed here has complexity O(∥E∥f(∥E∥)). The algorithm is specialized to the following cases: (i) B = all subsets of E, (ii) B = all subsets of E with k elements, (iii) B = all spanning trees in a network, and (iv) B = all paths in a directed acyclic network. Different types of weight functions are considered. It is shown that this proposed algorithm unifies many existing algorithms."

The root of this spanning tree is often elected as a leader, and then centralized algorithms are run in the distributed system. If, however, we have fault tolerance in mind, selecting a random spanning tree and a random leader are more desirable. If we manage to select a random tree, the probability that a bad channel will disconnect some nodes from the random tree is relatively small. Otherwise, a small number of predetermined edges will greatly effect the system's behavior.",

    abstract = { We present a randomized O(log n/log log n)-approximation algorithm for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP). This provides the first asymptotic improvement over the long-standing Θ(log n)-approximation bound stemming from the work of Frieze et al. (1982) [Frieze AM, Galbiati G, Maffioki F (1982) On the worst-case performance of some algorithms for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem. Networks 12(1):23–39]. The key ingredient of our approach is a new connection between the approximability of the ATSP and the notion of so-called thin trees. To exploit this connection, we employ maximum entropy rounding—a novel method of randomized rounding of LP relaxations of optimization problems. We believe that this method might be of independent interest. }

Since certain biases in the usage of k-lets are fundamental to biological sequences, effective generation of such sequences is essential for the evaluation of the results of many sequence analysis tools. This paper introduces two sequence shuffling algorithms: A simple swapping-based algorithm is shown to generate a near-random instance and appears to work well, although its efficiency is unproven; a generation algorithm based on Euler tours is proven to produce a precisely uniform instance, and hence solve the sequence shuffling problem, in time not much more than linear in the sequence length."

ABSTRACT = {We consider the problem of uniformly generating a spanning tree for an undirected connected graph. This process is useful for computing statistics, namely for phylogenetic trees. We describe a Markov chain for producing these trees. For cycle graphs, we prove that this approach significantly outperforms existing algorithms. For general graphs, experimental results show that the chain converges quickly. This yields an efficient algorithm due to the use of proper fast data structures. To obtain the mixing time of the chain we describe a coupling, which we analyze for cycle graphs and simulate for other graphs.},
